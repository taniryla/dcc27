Challenge: 27-countTheBits
Difficulty:  Intermediate
Prompt:
- Write a function called countTheBits that accepts a single numeric argument that will be an integer.
- The function should return the number of bits that are set to 1 in the number's binary representation.
Hints:
- We typically work with "decimal" numbers on a daily basis. Decimal is "base 10", where there are 10 digits available - 0 thru 9.  However, it's binary that computers understand - 1's and 0's.  The 1's and 0's are called bits.
- As an example, the decimal value of 13 is represented in binary as 1101.  There are 3 one bits and 1 zero bit in the decimal number of 13.
- Carefully read the documentation for the Number.prototype.toString method.
Examples:
countTheBits( 0 ) // => 0
countTheBits( 13 ) // => 3
countTheBits( 256 ) // => 1
countTheBits( 255 ) //=> 8
countTheBits( 65535 )  //=> 16
